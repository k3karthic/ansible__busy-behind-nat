# Access BUSY behind NAT

On certain ISPs like Jio, it is not possible to access a server over the interenet as Jio does not provide a public IPv4 address. This means that it is not possible to access [BUSY](https://busy.in/) using the provided [Mobile App](https://www.busywinsoftware.com/products/busy-mobile-app/).

## Run for Free

You can run the OpenVPN server for free by using the [Oracle Cloud Always Free](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/#always-free) tier. Terraform script for deploying a server can be found at [terraform__oci-instance-1](https://github.com/k3karthic/terraform__oci-instance-1).
